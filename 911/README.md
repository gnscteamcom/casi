# 911 Command
### Configuration
```lua

displayTime = 300 -- Refreshes Blips every 5 Minutes by Default --  
ondutycommand = 'onduty' -- Change this if you already have a 'onduty' command already set --
passwordmode = true -- By Changing this to 'false' it will make it so you need a password to go on-duty --  { For the 'passwordmode' and 'password' to work you need to have 'ondutymode' set to 'true' } --
password = '159' -- Please change this to your desired password -- { For the 'passwordmode' and 'password' to work you need to have 'ondutymode' set to 'true' } --
